# SnakeGame
The game screen displays a snake (chain of blocks) always in motion and a block at a fixed point on the screen.
The direction of the snake can be controlled by the arrows keys, which switch its direction.
The objective of the snake is to eat the target food block, which makes it grow in length.
The snake can die by eating itself (when it collides with itself) or by hitting the boundaries of the console.
